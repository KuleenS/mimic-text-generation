ray demonstrated <PAR> stable prominence of the right main pulmonary artery no <PAR> focal areas of consolidation overall stable appearance of <PAR> the chest compared with a [ 2101/10/15 ] study No <PAR> radiographic evidence of congestive heart failure or <PAR> pneumonia <PAR> <PAR> His admission electrocardiogram demonstrated a sinus rhythm , <PAR> nonspecific inferior / lateral T wave changes , low QRS voltages <PAR> in the limb leads , and T wave changes in V5 and V6 when <PAR> compared with an electrocardiogram dated [ 2101/10/12 ] <PAR> <PAR> An initial abdominal CT was a limited noncontrast examination <PAR> that demonstrated diffuse vascular calcifications No <PAR> evidence of an abdominal aortic aneurysm or free fluid , <PAR> incompletely imaged coronary artery calcification , a simple <PAR> left renal cyst , sigmoid diverticulosis , and an enlarged and <PAR> partially calcified prostate gland <PAR> <PAR> HOSPITAL COURSE BY SYSTEM : <PAR> <PAR> 1 CARDIOVASCULAR : The patient was initially admitted to <PAR> the Vascular Intensive Care Unit with hypotension , decreased <PAR> urine output , and acute renal failure most likely secondary <PAR> to a presumed gram - negative urosepsis ( although there were <PAR> never any positive culture data to confirm this diagnosis ) <PAR> <PAR> While <uk> in the Medical Intensive Care Unit on the <PAR> night of admission , the patient had a sudden <PAR> cardiorespiratory arrest He was resuscitated with <PAR> epinephrine , lidocaine , and direct current cardioversion <PAR> times four He was also intubate for airway protection <PAR> <PAR> Following these measures , the patient returned to a sinus <PAR> rhythm with a systolic blood pressure of approximately 100 <PAR> the total time <uk> from the beginning of the arrest to <PAR> the return of a pulse was approximately 16 minutes He <PAR> subsequently required double pressors to maintain his blood <PAR> pressure <PAR> <PAR> An echocardiogram performed at the bedside demonstrated a <PAR> trivial pericardial effusion and a left ventricular ejection <PAR> fraction of 20 % to 25 % in the setting of tachycardia and a <PAR> hyperdynamic right ventricle suggesting elevated right - sided <PAR> filling pressures Although the definitive etiology of this <PAR> arrest remained unknown , the most likely trigger was a <PAR> non - Q - wave myocardial infarction , as his troponin values were <PAR> elevated to greater than 50 following his arrest <PAR> <PAR> A repeat echocardiogram done on [ 2101/10/21 ] <PAR> demonstrated mild left atrial dilation , an ejection fraction <PAR> of 15 % to 20 % , resting regional wall motion abnormalities <PAR> including inferior , mid , and apical left ventricular <PAR> akinesis , depressed right ventricular systolic function , and <PAR> moderate mitral regurgitation Compared with the prior study <PAR> of [ 2101/10/20 ] the left ventricular function was <PAR> unchanged There was moderate mitral regurgitation , and the <PAR> right ventricular function appeared worse <PAR> <PAR> On [ 2101/10/21 ] , the patient was loaded with amiodarone <PAR> and was subsequently started on oral amiodarone The <PAR> following day , he was started on heparin intravenously given <PAR> his elevated serum troponin to greater than 50 this <PAR> medication was continued for 72 hours Given his elevated <PAR> troponins and non - Q - wave myocardial infarction , the patient <PAR> was a candidate for cardiac catheterization <PAR> <PAR> After discussions between the Medical Intensive Care Unit <PAR> team and the patient \\'s family , however , the decision was made <PAR> to not pursue further invasive procedures given that the <PAR> patient had been made do not resuscitate / do not intubate <PAR> following the resuscitation mentioned above , and his family <PAR> no longer wished for aggressive <uk> measures <PAR> <PAR> By [ 2101/10/23 ] , he was off pressors and he was <PAR> restarted on a beta blocker and ACE inhibitor at low doses <PAR> <PAR> On the evening of [ 2101/10/25 ] , the patient complained <PAR> of substernal chest pain that was relieved by <uk> SL and <PAR> morphine He also had ST segment depressions in V2 and V3 <PAR> that reverted to baseline after the resolution of his pain <PAR> Therefore , the patient was again started on heparin <PAR> although , this was discontinued on [ 2101/10/26 ] when <PAR> the patient ruled out for a myocardial infarction by cardiac <PAR> enzymes He again had substernal chest pain on [ 2101/10/27 ] although , he had no electrocardiogram changes , and he <PAR> again ruled out for a myocardial infarction by cardiac <PAR> enzymes <PAR> <PAR> By hospital day four , the patient began to develop evidence <PAR> of congestive heart failure given his aggressive fluid <PAR> resuscitation , and gentle diuresis with furosemide was begun <PAR> By the time of his transfer to the General Medicine Service <PAR> on [ 2101/10/26 ] , the patient was still significantly <PAR> volume overloaded following his aggressive fluid <PAR> resuscitation in the Medical Intensive Care Unit Therefore , <PAR> he was continued on the program of gentle diuresis given that <PAR> he was having signs and symptoms of right - sided congestive <PAR> heart failure He achieved adequate diuresis by the time of <PAR> his discharge to rehabilitation , as his oxygen saturation was <PAR> greater than 95 % on 2 liters nasal cannula <PAR> <PAR> 2 INFECTIOUS DISEASE / SEPSIS : The patient was started on <PAR> gentamicin and piperacillin / tazobactam in addition to the <PAR> levofloxacin , metronidazole , and vancomycin he was already <PAR> taking for right lower extremity cellulitis prior to <PAR> admission for empiric coverage of a presumed gram - negative <PAR> urosepsis , and he was aggressively hydrated with intravenous <PAR> fluids <PAR> <PAR> On [ 2101/10/21 ] , his levofloxacin and metronidazole was <PAR> discontinued , and he was started on fluconazole given the <PAR> growth of yeast on urine culture He was taken off of <PAR> gentamicin on hospital day three , and his fluconazole was <PAR> discontinued on hospital day five ( as per the Infectious <PAR> Disease Service ) He was taken off of vancomycin on <PAR> [ 2101/10/28 ] , and his piperacillin / tazobactam was <PAR> discontinued on [ 2101/10/29 ] <PAR> <PAR> Despite the <uk> of a gram -
