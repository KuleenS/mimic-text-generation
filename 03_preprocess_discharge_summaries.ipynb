negative urosepsis ( although there were <PAR> never any positive culture data to confirm this diagnosis ) <PAR> <PAR> While boarding in the Medical Intensive Care Unit on the <PAR> night of admission , the patient had a sudden <PAR> cardiorespiratory arrest He was resuscitated with <PAR> epinephrine , lidocaine , and direct current cardioversion <PAR> times four He was also intubate for airway protection <PAR> <PAR> Following these measures , the patient returned to a sinus <PAR> rhythm with a systolic blood pressure of approximately 100 <PAR> the total time elapsed from the beginning of the arrest to <PAR> the return of a pulse was approximately 16 minutes He <PAR> subsequently required double pressors to maintain his blood <PAR> pressure <PAR> <PAR> An echocardiogram performed at the bedside demonstrated a <PAR> trivial pericardial effusion and a left ventricular ejection <PAR> fraction of 20 % to 25 % in the setting of tachycardia and a <PAR> hyperdynamic right ventricle suggesting elevated right - sided <PAR> filling pressures Although the definitive etiology of this <PAR> arrest remained unknown , the most likely trigger was a <PAR> non - Q - wave myocardial infarction , as his troponin values were <PAR> elevated to greater than 50 following his arrest <PAR> <PAR> A repeat echocardiogram done on [ 2101/10/21 ] <PAR> demonstrated mild left atrial dilation , an ejection fraction <PAR> of 15 % to 20 % , resting regional wall motion abnormalities <PAR> including inferior , mid , and apical left ventricular <PAR> akinesis , depressed right ventricular systolic function , and <PAR> moderate mitral regurgitation Compared with the prior study <PAR> of [ 2101/10/20 ] the left ventricular function was <PAR> unchanged There was moderate mitral regurgitation , and the <PAR> right ventricular function appeared worse <PAR> <PAR> On [ 2101/10/21 ] , the patient was loaded with amiodarone <PAR> and was subsequently started on oral amiodarone The <PAR> following day , he was started on heparin intravenously given <PAR> his elevated serum troponin to greater than 50 this <PAR> medication was continued for 72 hours Given his elevated <PAR> troponins and non - Q - wave myocardial infarction , the patient <PAR> was a candidate for cardiac catheterization <PAR> <PAR> After discussions between the Medical Intensive Care Unit <PAR> team and the patient 's family , however , the decision was made <PAR> to not pursue further invasive procedures given that the <PAR> patient had been made do not resuscitate / do not intubate <PAR> following the resuscitation mentioned above , and his family <PAR> no longer wished for aggressive resuscitating measures <PAR> <PAR> By [ 2101/10/23 ] , he was off pressors and he was <PAR> restarted on a beta blocker and ACE inhibitor at low doses <PAR> <PAR> On the evening of [ 2101/10/25 ] , the patient complained <PAR> of substernal chest pain that was relieved by NPG SL and <PAR> morphine He also had ST segment depressions in V2 and V3 <PAR> that reverted to baseline after the resolution of his pain <PAR> Therefore , the patient was again started on heparin <PAR> although , this was discontinued on [ 2101/10/26 ] when <PAR> the patient ruled out for a myocardial infarction by cardiac <PAR> enzymes He again had substernal chest pain on [ 2101/10/27 ] although , he had no electrocardiogram changes , and he <PAR> again ruled out for a myocardial infarction by cardiac <PAR> enzymes <PAR> <PAR> By hospital day four , the patient began to develop evidence <PAR> of congestive heart failure given his aggressive fluid <PAR> resuscitation , and gentle diuresis with furosemide was begun <PAR> By the time of his transfer to the General Medicine Service <PAR> on [ 2101/10/26 ] , the patient was still significantly <PAR> volume overloaded following his aggressive fluid <PAR> resuscitation in the Medical Intensive Care Unit Therefore , <PAR> he was continued on the program of gentle diuresis given that <PAR> he was having signs and symptoms of right - sided congestive <PAR> heart failure He achieved adequate diuresis by the time of <PAR> his discharge to rehabilitation , as his oxygen saturation was <PAR> greater than 95 % on 2 liters nasal cannula <PAR> <PAR> 2 INFECTIOUS DISEASE / SEPSIS : The patient was started on <PAR> gentamicin and piperacillin / tazobactam in addition to the <PAR> levofloxacin , metronidazole , and vancomycin he was already <PAR> taking for right lower extremity cellulitis prior to <PAR> admission for empiric coverage of a presumed gram - negative <PAR> urosepsis , and he was aggressively hydrated with intravenous <PAR> fluids <PAR> <PAR> On [ 2101/10/21 ] , his levofloxacin and metronidazole was <PAR> discontinued , and he was started on fluconazole given the <PAR> growth of yeast on urine culture He was taken off of <PAR> gentamicin on hospital day three , and his fluconazole was <PAR> discontinued on hospital day five ( as per the Infectious <PAR> Disease Service ) He was taken off of vancomycin on <PAR> [ 2101/10/28 ] , and his piperacillin / tazobactam was <PAR> discontinued on [ 2101/10/29 ] <PAR> <PAR> Despite the presumption of a gram -

year - old <PAR> African - American male with a history of hypertension who was <PAR> in his usual state of health until about 10 : 25 a m. on the <PAR> morning of admission He had gone to use the restroom and a <PAR> few minutes later his family found him slumped onto the <PAR> floor , apparently unable to talk and with weakness in his <PAR> right arm and leg EMS was called and he was brought into <PAR> the Emergency Department at [ Hospital1 18 ] <PAR> <PAR> The patient has not had strokes or previous similar symptoms <PAR> He has a history of hypertension but no history of cardiac <PAR> symptoms The patient was unable to talk for examination and <PAR> no family members were present at the bedside and were not at <PAR> home ( apparently they were on the way to the Emergency Room ) <PAR> The history was obtained by EMS <PAR> <PAR> PAST MEDICAL HISTORY : Hypertension <PAR> <PAR> ADMISSION MEDICATIONS : The patient was on no medications <PAR> upon admission <PAR> <PAR> ALLERGIES : The patient has no known drug allergies <PAR> <PAR> FAMILY HISTORY : Unknown <PAR> <PAR> SOCIAL HISTORY : The patient lives [ Location ( un ) 6409 ] <PAR> <PAR> PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION : During the five minute <PAR> examination , the patient became progressively less responsive <PAR> and then vomited requiring intubation and paralytics during <PAR> the examination Vital signs : Blood pressure 229/137 , heart <PAR> rate 85 , respiratory rate 20 , temperature 98.8 General : <PAR> This was a well - developed African - American male HEENT : The <PAR> neck was supple without lymphadenopathy or thyromegaly <PAR> Cardiovascular : Regular rate and rhythm No murmurs , rubs , <PAR> or gallops noted Lungs : Clear to auscultation bilaterally <PAR> Abdomen : Soft , nontender , nondistended with no hepatomegaly <PAR> Extremities : No clubbing , cyanosis or edema noted <PAR> Neurologic : On the mental status examination , the patient <PAR> was alert but nonverbal Language was aphasic but can <PAR> comprehend one - step commands There was no evidence of <PAR> neglect The patient can follow one - step commands On the <PAR> cranial nerve examination , his optic disk margins were sharp <PAR> His extraocular eye movements were intact His pupils were <PAR> equal and reactive to light His face was symmetrical at <PAR> rest Motor : He had normal bulk and tone with no tremors <PAR> His power was 0/5 in the right arm and leg His left arm and <PAR> leg was apparently [ 5 -

ray showed cardiomegaly with CHF <PAR> <PAR> HOSPITAL COURSE : 1 NEUROLOGIC : Left putaminal bleed <PAR> secondary to presumed hypertension The patient 's blood <PAR> pressure was initially controlled with a Nipride drip to keep <PAR> the cephalic pressure between 130 - 160 The Nipride drip was <PAR> then weaned as labetalol IV was added along with a <PAR> nicardipine drip The patient was also given Dilantin load <PAR> followed by a maintenance dose of 400 mg q d His level has <PAR> been therapeutic around 20 Considerations for a CTA and <PAR> angiogram for possible AVM or aneurysm were considered but <PAR> the patient 's renal function and health status did not allow <PAR> such studies to be done at the current time <PAR> <PAR> Repeated noncontrast CT of the head revealed no increase in <PAR> the bleeding but showed subsequently increases in cerebral <PAR> edema with some pressure onto the brain stem The patient 's <PAR> neurological examination did deteriorate to the point that he <PAR> only had reactive pupils that were equal and intact corneal <PAR> reflexes In addition , he had a gag reflex However , he <PAR> began to not move any extremities and not respond to any <PAR> noxious stimuli in the four extremities <PAR> <PAR> By 4 : 00 p m. on [ 2149/11/13 ] , his neurological condition <PAR> deteriorated to the point that his pupils were dilated and <PAR> nonreactive He lost gag and corneal reflex Calorics were <PAR> done at this time which revealed no response Neurosurgery <PAR> was reconsulted for a question of craniotomy but they felt <PAR> that the patient would not be a candidate for the surgery in <PAR> that it would not help him Mannitol was then started along <PAR> with hyperventilation to keep the PC02 below 30 in an attempt <PAR> to decrease the cerebral edema <PAR> <PAR> Despite clinical examination that the patient is clinically <PAR> brain dead , the family wishes to continue aggressive <PAR> treatment The family requested that the patient be <PAR> transferred to the [ Hospital6 1129 ] However , <PAR> Dr [ Last Name ( STitle ) 54029 ] at the [ Hospital3 ] Stroke Service said <PAR> that the patient would not be accepted at the [ Hospital3 ] given that there would be no other intervention that <PAR> would be done differently at [ Hospital3 ] <PAR> <PAR> 2 CARDIOVASCULAR : As mentioned above , the patient was <PAR> initially started on a Nipride drip to control the blood <PAR> pressure between 130 - 160 However , he was slowly weaned off <PAR> the Nipride to be switched over to Cardene drip The Cardene <PAR> drip was then weaned to allow for the addition of p o <PAR> Labetalol Three serial CKs and troponins were checked and <PAR> found to be negative , thus , ruling the patient out for a <PAR> myocardial infarction <PAR> <PAR> 3 PULMONARY : The patient was initially intubated when <PAR> first seen down in the Emergency Room for airway protection <PAR> since he vomited He then showed a left lower lobe pneumonia <PAR> on the chest x - ray He was started on levofloxacin and <PAR> Flagyl since the day of admission for aspiration pneumonia <PAR> Vancomycin was added on day number four of hospitalization <PAR> due to sputum cultures showing Staphylococcus aureus <PAR> coagulase - positive organisms and gram - negative rods <PAR> Susceptibilities are still pending The patient did have one <PAR> or two episodes of desaturation secondary to breathing trials <PAR> and increased secretion in his nostrils In an attempt to <PAR> decongest him , saline nasal spray was started <PAR> <PAR> 4 RENAL : Acute renal failure secondary to dehydration <PAR> The patient 's creatinine upon admission was 1.4 and continued <PAR> to rise to 2 as he started third spacing his fluids Urine <PAR> electrolytes were checked which showed a phena of less than 1 <PAR> which is evidence of the patient being dehydrated and <PAR> prerenal He was subsequently given IV fluids and his <PAR> creatinine improved to 1.6 A renal ultrasound was done <PAR> which showed no evidence of hydronephrosis <PAR> <PAR> 5 INFECTIOUS DISEASE : Leukocytosis : Given the aspiration <PAR> pneumonia and elevated white count of 18.6 , levofloxacin and <PAR> Flagyl were started on the day of admission Blood cultures <PAR> were obtained The first two sets showed one out of four <PAR> blood cultures that grew staphylococcus coagulase - negative <PAR> Since this was deemed a contaminent , no further antibiotics <PAR> were given However , on day number four of hospitalization , <PAR> his sputum culture returned showing Staphylococcus <PAR> coagulase - positive organisms so vancomycin was added More <PAR> blood cultures were drawn but nothing has grown to date <PAR> <PAR> 6 GASTROINTESTINAL : The patient was given and orogastric <PAR> tube for tube feeds He had some high residuals so the tube <PAR> feeds were stopped Reglan was then administered to promote <PAR> GI motility so that the tube feeds could be restarted <PAR> <PAR> 7 FLUIDS , ELECTROLYTES , AND NUTRITION : Hyponatremia : The <PAR> patient 's sodium slowly fell from 136 upon admission to 130 <PAR> on the fourth day of hospitalization It was felt that this <PAR> was due to salt wasting from his cerebral problems so he was <PAR> then fluid restricted Although he has acute renal failure <PAR> secondary to dehydration and third spacing , it was felt that <PAR> he needed to be fluid restricted given that the overall <PAR> hyponatremia was more likely due to salt wasting <PAR> <PAR> <PAR> <PAR> <PAR> [ First Name8 ( NamePattern2 ) ] [ First Name8 ( NamePattern2 ) 5930 ] [ Last Name ( NamePattern1 ) ] , M D.
